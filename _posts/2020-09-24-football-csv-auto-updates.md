title:  "football.csv - Now Auto-Updated Every 24 Hours via GitHub Actions Workflow / Build"
---

A first little experiment using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for more automation. The [football.csv datasets](https://github.com/footballcsv) for

- `/england`
- `/deutschland`
- `/espana`
- `/austria`
- `/belgium`
- `/mexico`

now get auto-updated every 24 hours
at 5 am (UTC) thanks to GitHub Actions from the (single-source)
datasets in the (structured) text format also known as Football.TXT.

Find the source for the workflow update/build machinery
in the [`yorobot/workflow`](https://github.com/yorobot/workflow) repo 
or see the [actions in action](https://github.com/yorobot/workflow/actions).

Enjoy the beautiful game.
