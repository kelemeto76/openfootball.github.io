title:  "Reorg - New `football.db` Datasets / Repos for Europe and South America"
---

Reorganized the `football.db` datasets a little.
The ~~`/brazil`~~ country repo is now [`/south-america`](https://github.com/openfootball/south-america) and includes
datasets from Argentina and more countries upcoming.

The ~~`/france`~~ country repo is now [`/europe`](https://github.com/openfootball/europe) and includes all
datasets from Europe (e.g. Belgium, Netherlands, Ireland, Iceland,
Scotland, etc.) from the [`/world`](https://github.com/openfootball/world) repo.

Enjoy the beautiful game.
